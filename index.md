## Pomo - the menubar pomodoro timer

Pomo is a simple, minimal, and visually pleasing pomodoro timer that lives in your menu bar. Pomo revolves around the pomodoro method, a productivity technique that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

Pomo aims to unintrusively increase your productivity through thos method. 

### Features

**Unintrusive in your menubar**

Pomo quietly lives in your menubar so you can open it briefly when needed and not worry about another app cluttering your desktop. 

**Minimal notifications so you can focus on work**

Get automatically alerted when there are 5 minutes left in the timer, and when it has completed.  

**Customize every aspect to your preference**

Change the length of break and work timers, as well as the amount of work sessions. _Themes/dark mode coming soon._

**Built for macOS**

Pomo is built with Electron and React, and therefore compatible with all versions of macOS starting with macOS 10.11 (El Capitan) including Intel and M1 Macs. _Windows/Linux is untested/unsupported_
